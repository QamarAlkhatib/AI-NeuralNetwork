 **The accuracy of correct prediction is 86%**

 * This code for learning purpos and you can access to the udemy course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/)

This course is for all students level, but for me it's great to know python for better understanding for the code 

### Activation function
Sigmoid Function
